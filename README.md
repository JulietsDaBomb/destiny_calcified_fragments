# Destiny Calcified Fragments Tracker

*** Note: this fragment tracker only uses grimoire so all results are per account not per character ***

This python script allows you to see what calcified fragments you still need as well as information on how to obtain it if possible. Please help contribute to the repo if you want to add additional information to the script such as links to videos if you want to make it more accessible to people.
